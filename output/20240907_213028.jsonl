And we really don’t know more about children than tropical fish, so the responsibility frightens the life out of us each morning. We don’t have a plan, we just do our best to get through the day, because there’ll be another one coming along tomorrow.\n\nIt’s a little known fact that tropical fish are excellent listeners—at least, they would be if they weren't so busy. You see, fish might swim in circles and stare blankly at you, but trust me, they have more on their minds than just the color of the rocks in their tank. Each time I try to talk to them, they just dart away like I've offended them, leaving me to wonder if I’m harboring a deep-seated fear of commitment in their eyes, or if they’re just avoiding discussing the food situation.\n\nAnd let’s talk about feeding them—what an experience. We tried feeding them one of those fancy flake foods. I mean, it looked like glittery confetti for fish! But instead of a feast, it turned into a game of 'who can catch the most before it dissolves into fishy confetti.' Spoiler alert: none of us were invited back to that party.\n\nIn reality, it was like hosting a dinner party for folks who live only on the far-left side of all the dietary restrictions. Fish, who could snack on micro-bits of flakes all day long, suddenly decided they were on a strict ‘no flake’ diet and instead opted to play ‘dodge the human’ as I tried to coax them into eating something before it ended up as some kind of fishy guacamole on the bottom of their tank. And when they did eat, they seemed to be having a little fish-estado fiesta, while I was stuck watching with the keen eye of a worried mother worrying over her children potentially choking on their food. \n\nAt the end of the day, tropical fish were like that friend you really want to impress, but all they seem to do is flop around and act confused. After those fish passed on to the great aquarium in the sky, I realized I may be better off sticking to hobbies that don't involve mammal- or pet-related existential crises.

The boss didn’t place the emphasis on the words “investigative team” when he said that, but on “Stockholm,” as if coming from the capital was itself some sort of superpower.

His thumbs are still pressed to his eyebrows, this is his last chance to show the bosses that he can handle this himself, but how on earth is that going to work if you’ve only got witnesses like this woman?\n\n“Okeydokey!” the real estate agent chirrups, as if that were a real Swedish word."}]}

I mean, who doesn’t get a little jolly when discussing the joys of open-plan apartments on the day before New Year’s Eve? Picture it: a cozy home where the walls have ears – very spacious, yet there’s a nagging feeling that at least one tree is mourning its sacrifice at the hands of overzealous builders. \n\nNow let’s dive into the dream of homeownership! I always imagine potential buyers stepping into a house and saying, \"Wow, just what I always wanted - a never-ending echo when I scream about my in-laws visiting for the holidays!\" You can just see the joy in their eyes as they contemplate if they’ll be able to handle yet another ‘what are you doing with your life?’ interrogation over dinner. But of course, it’s not all doom and gloom. Imagine showing a house and casually dropping, \"Oh yes, this room doubles as a potato storage unit! Perfect for impromptu potato sack races with the kids.\"\n\nBut really, ask any real estate agent about their craziest days, and you might hear tales of bewildered buyers encountering a unique scenario where a bank robber bursts in mid-tour, brandishing a pistol. \"Talk about having an open-book policy!\" they’d chuckle, trying to suppress a grin while recalling the reaction of their starry-eyed customers who surely thought that was part of the property tour package! \n\nIt’s a classic scenario of the your friendly neighborhood agents battling the elements – whether it’s the odd bank heist or the infamous 'too-many-dogs-living-on-a-no-pets-allowed-premises' policy. Just when you think the day couldn’t get any weirder, a new batch of wild stories sprouts up, further coloring the thrilling world of real estate. And as the Realtor concludes, you have to wonder: what’s a more entertaining sales pitch than the prospect of dodging a bank robbery? Now that's a property transaction that comes with character! \n\nIn summary, real estate isn’t merely about houses; it’s about the wacky anecdotes that accompany them. After all, who wouldn’t want to buy into a lifestyle that includes neighbors who are either overly friendly or might just potentially point a gun at them? Honestly, just another day in the world of House Tricks!"}]}

He finds himself at a crossroads – between humor and confusion – as he faces the overly cheerful real estate agent at the other side of the table. There’s something about her sunny disposition that both amuses and irritates him; it’s like watching a puppy try to fetch a stick that’s firmly stuck between two rocks. It’s tough, really, because here they are having a conversation about a bank robber, and she’s chirping away like they’re discussing the weather. \"Okay! Let’s move on: when you saw the perpetrator, what was your first react—\" “Didn’t you say you were going to ask about the apartment first?” she interrupts with a grin, as if discussing layouts is on par with solving a capital crime. “You don’t like open-plan apartments? You like walls? There’s nothing wrong with walls!\n\n\"And suddenly, I feel like I’m watching an infomercial for an interior design show,\" he thinks to himself. She's selling apartments like they’re luxury spaceships ready to take you to Mars, and he’s just trying to figure out if the place could house a bank robber. Would there be enough storage for all his stolen loot? Meanwhile, she flashes the kind of smile that suggests she thinks the hostage situation is no big deal – just another day in the life of House Tricks, she must think. The comedy of it all is so stark it’s borderline absurd. As she continues to weave in her charm and undeniable enthusiasm about the apartment’s “scientific research” on daylight, he wonders if her real estate pitch comes alongside a complimentary sanity check.\n\nThen, of course, there's the stark reminder of how complex life has gotten. Here they are, a cop and a Realtor, trapped in a conversation that feels more like satire than reality. All she can think about amid all this chaos is the “brilliant area for kids” and how “children just love police cars.” Sure! Because nothing screams family-friendly environment like an armed bank robbery, right? In her mind, she’s navigating the emotional labyrinth of modern-day life – just find the bright spot, and surely everything will be fine! That’s the trick, after all.\n\nThe policeman massages his temples, his face a canvas of exhaustion, as he contemplates the absurdity of it all. His mother, with her lofty dreams of raising a fine son free from the shackles of societal expectations, would be rolling her eyes if she could see him now, trapped in an open-plan talking fest with an overly joyous real estate agent who’s never met a crisis she couldn’t fit into a real estate brochure. “Let’s make our next viewing appointment a fun day out!”\n\n“They love the sound of sirens too,” she chirps again, citing children in need of adrenaline in the form of flashing lights and screeching tires. He can almost hear her maintain her upbeat demeanor while it’s clear that the horror stories of his job are lurking behind the curtain at the side of this staged drama. Modern life really is not wading through a meandering river of tranquility; it’s a spiraling rollercoaster that’s both terrifying and filled with hilariously unexpected turns that have no safety harnesses – all while making the case for the merits of open-plan living spaces!"}]}

A police officer and a real estate agent are sitting in an interview room in the police station. The policeman looks barely twenty but is probably older, and the real estate agent looks more than forty but is probably younger. The police officer’s uniform is too small, the real estate agent’s jacket slightly too large. The real estate agent looks like she’d rather be somewhere else, and, after the past fifteen minutes of conversation, the policeman looks like he wishes the real estate agent were somewhere else, too. When the real estate agent smiles nervously and opens her mouth to say something, the policeman breathes in and out in a way that makes it hard to tell if he’s sighing or trying to clear his nose.\n\n“Just answer the question,” he pleads.\n\nThe Realtor nods quickly and blurts out:\n\n“How’s tricks?”\n\n“I said, just answer the question!” the policeman repeats, with an expression common in grown men who were disappointed by life at some point in their childhood and have never quite managed to stop feeling that way.\n\n“You asked me what my real estate agency is called!” the Realtor insists, drumming her fingers on the tabletop in a way that makes the policeman feel like throwing objects with sharp corners at her.\n\n“No I didn’t, I asked if the perpetrator who held you hostage together with—”\n\n“It’s called House Tricks! Get it? Because when you buy an apartment, you want to buy from someone who knows all the tricks, don’t you? So when I answer the phone, I say: Hello, you’ve reached the House Tricks Real Estate Agency! HOW’S TRICKS?”\n\nObviously the Realtor has just been through a traumatic experience, has been threatened with a pistol and held hostage, and that sort of thing can make anyone babble. The policeman tries to be patient. He presses his thumbs hard against his eyebrows, as if he hopes they’re two buttons and if he keeps them pressed at the same time for ten seconds he’ll be able to restore life to its factory settings.\n\n“Okaaay… But now I need to ask you a few questions about the apartment and the perpetrator,” he groans.\n\nIt has been a difficult day for him, too. The police station is small, resources are tight, but there’s nothing wrong with their competence. He tried to explain that over the phone to some boss’s boss’s boss right after the hostage drama, but naturally it was hopeless. They’re going to send some special investigative team from Stockholm to take charge of the whole case. The boss didn’t place the emphasis on the words “investigative team” when he said that, but on “Stockholm,” as if coming from the capital was itself some sort of superpower. More like a medical condition, the policeman thinks. His thumbs are still pressed to his eyebrows, this is his last chance to show the bosses that he can handle this himself, but how on earth is that going to work if you’ve only got witnesses like this woman?"}]}

Then the special negotiator (who had been dispatched from Stockholm by the boss’s boss, seeing as people in Stockholm seem to think they’re the only ones capable of talking on the phone) called the bank robber in the hope that a peaceful resolution could be reached. But the bank robber didn’t answer. Instead a single pistol shot rang out. By the time the police smashed in the door to the apartment it was already too late.\n\nWhen they reached the living room they found themselves trampling through blood.\n\nIn the staffroom of the police station the young policeman bumps into an older officer. The young man is fetching water, the older man is drinking coffee. Their relationship is complicated, as is often the case between police officers of different generations. At the end of your career you’re trying to find a point to it all, and at the start of it you’re looking for a purpose.\n\n“Morning!” the older man exclaims.\n\n“Hi,” the younger man says, slightly dismissively.\n\n“I’d offer you some coffee, but I suppose you’re still not a coffee drinker?” the old officer says, as if it were some sort of disability.\n\n“No,” the younger man replies, like someone turning down an offer of human flesh.\n\nThe older and younger men have little in common when it comes to food and drink, or anything else, for that matter, which is a cause of ongoing conflict whenever they’re stuck in the same police car at lunchtime.

All the while, two officers are left bewildered by her antics, proving that the world of policing conjures its own unique brand of absurdity. As the younger officer tries to maintain decorum amidst the chaos, we see a clear divide between his professional demeanor and the comedian’s air surrounding the real estate agent. Have the police dealt with so many absurdities in their careers that they’re left numb? Or is it that those on the outside, like our overly enthusiastic Realtor, view their interactions as an opportunity for improv comedy?\n\nAs she imagines the notorious good cop, bad cop routine involving phone books and iPhones, it becomes apparent that the real estate agent is a product of her industry—a realm where flashing a cheesy grin and a catchy phrase reign supreme. Is it too far-fetched to suggest that perhaps the real estate business traffics in more illusion than the police itself? After all, in an industry that sells aspirations in the form of houses, each agent is the ultimate performer, hoping the next punchline is a sale, while the police often end up as the punchline themselves.\n\nFor the older police officer, navigating this absurd situation feels like walking a tightrope—the comic relief beneath his heavily furrowed brow speaks volumes about the state of modern policing. He spends his time trying to talk sense into the chaotic environment generated by a self-inflating real estate agent, while his younger counterpart grapples with the definition of professionalism as he faces a barrage of misguided humor from a civilian who desperately wants a laugh amidst a serious situation. And though one officer keeps the show running, it's clear that the comedic potential of the scenario stretches way beyond a simple interrogation.\n\nUltimately, the reader finds laughter simmering beneath layers of tension, clearly articulating the absurd crossover where policing meets everyday life. The real estate agent, once a vessel of hope for home ownership, quickly turns into a caricuture of all those who need to align their hopes with reality, as she clings to her own brand of humor in the face of danger. As the absurdities of both the police force and civilian life mingle, we’re left questioning who the real clowns are in these tragicomical exchanges."}]}

Take for example, our young policeman, trying to manage a crisis while sporting a stylish yet unfortunate bump on his forehead—proof that the job can be as dangerous as it is comedic. He’s not just handling hostage situations; he’s also navigating the minefield of being a younger officer dealt with the age-old challenge of older colleagues who are both bemused by and inherently dismissive of his generation’s coffee preferences.\n\nSpeaking of coffee, let’s talk about that moment when the older officer offers him a steaming cup. It’s not just a drink; it’s a metaphoric olive branch dipped in cream and sugar. Yet, the younger officer's rejection is so intense, it feels like he turned down a luxury yacht in favor of an inflatable kiddie pool—defining not only their contrasting palates but the generational gap that makes their dialogues a source of humor. \"I mean, who doesn’t love a good hot dog laced with instant mashed potatoes?\" the older fellow seems to say. But seriously, it might be time for him to consider a salad—or more likely, a colon cleanse—that classic dish certainly comes with an expiration date!\n\nHand in hand with this culinary collision is their baffling banter that spills into their professional lives as well. While the young officer talks in oh-so-serious tones about firearms and criminals, the older officer recalls the last time he had the stomach flu over their shared black coffee, suspecting it was that roadside stand that served him ‘gourmet’ hot dogs. Who knew that years spent on the job leads to reminiscing about the bathroom adventures during a hostage negotiation? It’s this gymnastics of dramatics versus dullness that decorates their dialogues like tired decorations at an office Christmas party, both ridiculous and oddly relatable.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about the unintentional comedy as the young cop grapples with the absurdity of interviewing real estate agents who nonchalantly declare that hostages were never in danger because the robber wielded a toy gun. What a relief! Next time, I’ll just carry around an airsoft rifle and claim it's for home defense during a robbery—a truly clever loophole if only someone were angry enough after a bad property viewing!\n\nUltimately, their relationship showcases that humor often lies in the mundane details of real life, where these officers balance the ridiculous with the sobering reality of their jobs. They embody the belief that laughter can serve as a coping mechanism in violent scenes—a crucial tool in a cop's toolkit, right next to their badge and handcuffs. This kind of humor can make even the bleakest of situations bearable, a tradition as old as police work itself: not taking themselves too seriously, and perhaps, just perhaps finding solace in that inevitable clash of old-world wisdom and new-age nonsense."}]}

Assault me with an iPhone?”\n\nShe starts waving her arms about to illustrate assault by phone, and yelling in what the two officers can only assume is the real estate agent’s imitation of their accents:\n\n“Oh, hell, no, I’ve ended up liking my ex on Instagram as well! Delete! Delete!”\n\nThe younger police officer doesn’t look at all amused, which makes the real estate agent look less amused. In the meantime the older officer leans toward the younger officer’s notes and asks, as if the Realtor weren’t actually in the room: “So what did she say about the drawing?”\n\n“I didn’t get that far before you came in and interrupted!” the younger man snaps.\n\n“What drawing?” the real estate agent asks.\n\n“Well, as I was about to say before I was interrupted: we found this drawing in the stairwell, and we think the perpetrator may have dropped it. We’d like you to—,” the younger officer says, but the older officer interrupts him.\n\n“Have you talked to her about the pistol, then?”\n\n“Stop interfering!” the younger man hisses.\n\nThis makes the older officer throw his arms up and mutter: “Okay, okay, sorry I’m here.”\n\n“It wasn’t real! The pistol! It was a toy!” the real estate agent says quickly.\n\nThe older officer looks at her in surprise, then at the younger officer, before whispering in a way that only men of a certain age think is a whisper: “You… you haven’t told her?”\n\n“Told me what?” the real estate agent wonders.\n\nThe younger police officer sighs and folds the drawing, as carefully as if he were actually folding his older colleague’s face. Then he looks up at the Realtor.\n\n“Well, I was coming to that… You see, after the perpetrator released you and the other hostages, and we’d brought you here to the station…”\n\nThe older officer interrupts helpfully: “The perpetrator, the bank robber—he shot himself!”\n\nThe younger officer clasps his hands tightly together to stop himself from strangling the older man. He says something the real estate agent doesn’t hear: her ears are already full of a monotonous buzzing sound that grows to a roar as shock takes hold of her nervous system. Long afterward she will swear that rain was pattering against the window of the room, even though the interview room had no windows. She stares at the policemen with her jaw hanging open.\n\n“So… the pistol… it was…?” she manages to say.\n\n“It was a real pistol,” the older officer confirms.\n\n“I…,” the Realtor begins, but her mouth is too dry to speak.\n\n“Here! Have some water!” the older officer offers, as if he’d just fetched it for her.\n\n“Thanks… I… but, if the pistol was real, then we could all… we could all have died,” she whispers, then gulps at the water in a state of retroactive shock. The older officer nods authoritatively, takes the younger man’s notes from him, and starts to make his own additions with a pen.\n\n“Perhaps we should start this interview again?” he says helpfully, which prompts the younger officer to take a short break so he can go out into the corridor and bang his head against the wall.\n\nWhen the door slams shut the older man jumps. This business with words is tricky when you’re older and all you want to say to someone younger is: “I can see you’re in pain, and that causes me pain.” The younger officer’s shoes have left reddish brown marks of dried blood on the floor under his chair. The older man looks at them disconsolately. This was precisely why he didn’t want his son to become a policeman."}]}
